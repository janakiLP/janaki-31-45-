        <h4 class="head"  align="center">Understanding the<br>
            Competitive Environment</h4><hr class="hr">
        <p class="a">As in any game, the success of competitive strategies depends on knowing the<br>
            rules as well as the other players. Nevertheless, in the real competitive<br>
            environment, the rules are not always clear and can change very quickly,<br>
            demanding quick responses and making it increasingly difficult to map the<br>
            moves of the main players.</p>
        <p class="a">Strong monitoring channels must be maintained to follow changes in the<br>
            competitive environment and to discern new trends. Changes in the environ-<br>
            ment can result from emerging technologies or changes in society’s behavior,<br>
            and thus in clients’ demands. They can also be the result of competitors’ moves<br>
            in the market.</p>
        <p class="a">Thus developing a good competitive strategy depends on mapping the environ-<br>
            ment and constantly monitoring it to be able to capitalize quickly on opportun-<br>
            ities or neutralize threats.</p>
        <p class="a">The focus of this chapter is on mapping the environment. It will show the main<br>
            aspects of the model for industry analysis and explain the process of forming<br>
            strategic groups and pressure maps.</p>
        <h4 class="head" align="center">Industry Analysis</h4><hr class="hr">
        <p class="a">Porter (1979) developed a model to analyze the environment based on<br>
            mapping five competitive forces in order to better understand the rules of the<br>
            competitive game and to help companies to find a position in the industry with<br>
            greater clarity. During the 1990s, it was often remarked that environmental<br>
            analysis had little to contribute given the turbulent state of the new economy, but<br>
            Porter (2001) was able to demonstrate how important environmental analysis<br>
            is, especially when there are a large number of uncertainties.</p>
        <p class="a">A good map is most useful during a storm!
        </p>
        <p class="a">To develop a map of an industry, one needs to know how the main players<br>
            behave and how the battle for greater profitability works. According to Porter<br>
            (1979), there are five competitive forces that run through an industry: custom-<br>
            ers, suppliers, current competitors, new entrants, and substitute products or<br>
            services.</p>
        <p class="a">Understanding these five forces is vital to formulating a company’s competitive<br>
            strategy. The model for Industry Analysis is shown in Figure 2.1.</p>
        <p class="a">The pressures exercised by these forces are structural determinants both of<br>
            competition and of an industry’s profitability (Porter, 1979). In Figure 2.1, the<br>
            battle for profitability in the supply chain, i.e., the bargaining power of</p>
        <p class="a"><i>Figure 2.1. The five competitive forces (adapted from Porter, 1979)</i></p>
        <img src="figure2.png">
        <p class="a">customers and suppliers is laid out along the horizontal axis. The relationship<br>
            among competitors, whether those are already established, potential entrants,<br>
            or substitute products, is shown along the vertical axis.<br>
            </p>
        <p class="a">It is important to emphasize that industry, in this context, means an industrial<br>
            sector and not a single company.</p>
        <p class="a">The structure of an industrial sector depends on how the competitive forces are<br>
            configured. When they are stronger, there is less potential for profitability. It is<br>
            easy to imagine that within an industry with fierce competition, the rate of return<br>
            tends to be less. On the outside limit, an industrial structure with all five forces<br>
            intensified, approaches the economic model of “perfect competition.”
            </p>
        <p class="a">On the other hand, there are industries where the five competitive forces are<br>
            weak, i.e., the rivalry among existing competitors is not intense, the entry<br>
            barriers for new competitors are difficult to overcome, and there are no<br>
            substitute products. Allied to this favorable scenario, the sector is the driver of<br>
            the supply chain, with high bargaining power with the others tiers in the chains,<br>
            whether customers or suppliers. This type of industrial sector is called “five<br>
            star” since it shows a high potential for profitability.</p>
        <p class="a">Industry analysis allows us to identify which competitive forces most influence<br>
            the industrial sector. It is common for one force in the competitive industrial<br>
            environment to stand out and the competitive strategy should focus on it. It is<br>
            then possible to influence the competitive environment in such a way as to<br>
            assume a strategic position that can neutralize it, and thus to obtain a sustainable<br>
            competition advantage, as seen in Chapter I.</p>
        <p class="a">It is worth emphasizing that the map of the sector structure is dynamic, since the<br>
            industry can undergo changes and, depending on the magnitude of the competi-<br>
            tive movement of each player, the shape of the five forces can be altered, having<br>
            an impact on its attractiveness.</p>
       <h4 class="head">Mapping the Competitive Forces in the Supply Chain:<br>
            Relationships with Customers and Suppliers</h4><hr class="hr">
        <p class="a">Bargaining power in the relationship with customers and suppliers has a<br>
            decisive impact on both an industry’s profitability and attractiveness. Imagine<br>
            the vehicle assembly plants and their auto parts suppliers seated around the<br>
            bargaining table. It is east to predict that the scale will tilt toward the side of the<br>
            assemblers.</p>
        <p class="a">When the customers are concentrated and direct large volumes, such as the<br>
            case of the assembly plants, they manage to bargain for better prices, increasing<br>
            demands for quality, flexibility in the product mix and the volume of production,<br>
            as well as access to information via Integrated Management Systems — ERP.<br>
            They thus diminish the industry’s freedom to establish its own rules. This<br>
            situation is aggravated when the products supplied by the industrial sector are<br>
            standardized, are not critical to the quality of the customers’ production, and<br>
            can be substituted without generating costs for the change (Carvalho et al.,<br>
            2003).
            </p>
        <p class="a">Table 2.1 shows some aspects, which determine the bargaining power of an<br>
            industry, tilting the balance when they are present.</p>
        <p class="a">When the forces in the supply chain are intense, it is important to outline a<br>
            strategy for buyers and suppliers, with criteria for choosing buyers and for<br>
            selecting target customers and also for developing a buying strategy, paying<br>
            attention to strategic aspects and not just operational ones.</p>
        <p class="a">This matrix proposed by Cox et al. (2001) is a useful tool for analyzing<br>
            bargaining power between buyers and suppliers. Figure 2.2 shows the matrix,<br>
            where the horizontal axis shows the dominance of the supplier and the vertical<br>
            shows the dominance of the buyer, and four quadrants: buyer dominance,<br>
            interdependence, independence, and supplier dominance.</p>
        <p class="a">The quadrants of buyer dominance and supplier dominance indicate who has<br>
            power over the other. In the independence quadrant, buyers and suppliers have<br>
            attributes of power, and both must be involved in order to carry out any agreed<br>
            upon exchanges. In the independence quadrant, neither of the two have<br>
            attributes of power, nor are they capable of demanding that the other fulfill their<br>
            requirements, and both have other opportunities for doing business.</p>

        <p class="a">Yet in the more complex supply chains, a more detailed analysis of the<br>
            relationship among the links must be done. It is necessary to identify which link<br>
            commands the chain, i.e., dominates the strategic activities which add value.<br>
            Two aspects take on special importance in this analysis, as we will see in more<br>
            detail in Chapter III — governance of the chain and the value system</p>
        <h4 class="head">Analyzing the Competitors: Current, Potential and<br>
            Substitutions</h4><hr class="hr">
        <p class="a">Competition in a given industry can be a factor that significantly limits profitabil-<br>
            ity. In an industry with an intense rivalry, this can lead to predatory actions,<br>
            eroding the attractiveness and profitability of the industry as a whole.</p>
        <p class="a">It is important to note that rivalry should not be analyzed just in the context of<br>
            existing competitors, but also in the extended rivalry which includes new<br>
            entrants and substitute products and services, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. In<br>
            industries that are threatened by substitute products or have a high potential for<br>
            new entrants, competition tends to be sharper and often sets off price wars</p>
        <p class="a">There are many aspects that have an impact on the rivalry among established<br>
            competitors in an industry and in the battle for market share and better<br>
            competitive positioning. Imagine, for example, a sector where growth is slow<br>
            or stagnant! For a company to grow, it has to take market shares from the</p>
        <p class="a"><i>Figure 2.3. Forces of competition: competitors, entrants and substitutes</i></p>
        <img src="figure4.PNG">
        <p class="a">competitors, increasing rivalry among the established competitors, which is not<br>
            the case when the industry is growing overall.</p>
        <p class="a">The main points to be verified in analyzing the forces of competition are:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 5%;font-size: 14px;">
            <li>Numerous or balanced competitors</li>
            <li> Slow growth of the industry</li>
            <li>High fixed costs</li>
            <li>Absence of differentiation</li>
            <li>Increased capacity in large increments</li>
            <li> Competitors with divergent strategies</li>
            <li>High exit barriers</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="a">When rivalry is extensive, the threat of new entrants to an industry is strongly<br>
            related to the effective entry barriers and the expectation of potential competi-<br>
            tors regarding retaliation from already established players.</p>
        <p class="a">The main source of entry barriers for new competitors is the economies of<br>
            scales, whether for production, research, marketing, or services, which require<br>
            that the entrant operate on a large scale or which place the entrant at a cost<br>
            disadvantage. In addition to this barrier, there are cost disadvantages, which<br>
            are independent of scale, such as patent costs, access to raw material, location,<br>
            official subsidies, and learning curves. For a long time, Xerox took advantage</p>
        <p class="a"><i>Figure 2.4. Factors affecting the learning curve (adapted from Heizer and<br>
            Render, 1999)</i></p>
        <img src="figure5.PNG">
        <p class="a">of its patent for the copying machine to remain all alone in the market, however,<br>
            when the patent expired, a lot of entrants such as Canon, Hewlett Packard, and<br>
            others came on the scene.</p>
        <p class="a">According to Heizer and Render (1999), learning curve models were first<br>
            observed for the aeronautics industry. It has been calculated that for the period<br>
            1925-1957, the number of worker-hours per unit was reduced by 80%.</p>
        <p class="a">Learning curves, when applied to the context of strategy, allow us to determine<br>
            changes in the volume-cost trade-off, and to evaluate performance for the<br>
            business and the industry. The major restrictions to these models are related to<br>
            the wide range of variables, which need to be analyzed, as illustrated in Figure<br>
            2.4.</p>
        <p class="a">Other important sources of barriers are:<i>product differentiation, capital<br>
            requirements, change cost and access to distribution channels</i></p>
        <p class="a">The threat of new entrants can also affect expectations regarding retaliation<br>
            from already established competitors, especially when excess capacity and/or<br>
            capital are available to maintain and sustain a direct battle.
            </p>
        <p class="a">Finally, the last force of competition to be analyzed is the pressure of substitute<br>
            products/services. Substitutes can be defined as those which carry out the same<br>
            function, even with another technology base (another industry). Substitutes,<br>
            which are subject to price/performance, trade off with products from the<br>
            industry and/or those produced by five-star industries merit the most attention.</p>
        <h4 class="head" align="center">Taking a Look Inside the Industry</h4><hr class="hr">
        <p class="a">As we saw earlier, even though all the companies within an industry are subject<br>
            to the same forces of competition, they adopt different strategic positions with<br>
            different results. Therefore, the analysis of the overall industry can be deep-<br>
            ened, extending to a structural analysis within the industry</p>
        <p class="a">The steps for doing a structural analysis inside the industry are:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 5%;font-size: 14px;">
            <li><b class="c">First step:</b>Characterize the strategies of all the significant competitors in<br>
                all their dimensions.</li>
            <li> <b class="c">Second step:</b> Evaluate the dimensions and the composition of the<br>
                mobility barriers, which protect each group.
                </li>
            <li><b class="c">Third step:</b> Evaluate the relative bargaining power of each strategic<br>
                group in the industry vis-a-vis their buyers and suppliers.</li>
            <li><b class="c">Fourth step:</b> Evaluate the relative position of each strategic group with<br>
                regard to substitute products.
                </li>
            <li><b class="c">Fifth step:</b> Evaluate the patterns of interdependence in the market among<br>
                the strategic groups and their vulnerability to conflict initiated by other<br>
                groups.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4 class="head">Dimensions of Competitive Strategy</h4><hr class="hr">
        <p class="a">The breadth of different strategies throughout an industry depends on the nature<br>
            of the industry. The choice of strategy has repercussions in the strategic<br>
            dimension, which demands trade-offs. According to Porter (1987) the follow-<br>
            ing dimensions can be identified:

                <p class="a">Strategic groups cluster firms in groups of similar companies, forming an<br>
                    analytical tool that makes it easier to analyze the industry. The strategic-group<br>
                    method assumes that similar firms react in a similar way to external disturbances<br>
                    (Feka et al., 1997). While the company should stake out a singular position, it</p>
                <p class="a">is possible to identify strategic groups that are following the same or a similar<br>
                    strategy within an industry (see the section titled Dimensions of Competitive<br>
                    Strategy). These strategic groups usually diverge in their approaches to the<br>
                    product or to marketing. Even though there could be cases of a single strategic<br>
                    group in an industry, these are rare.</p>
                <p class="a">An industry’s historical development explains differences in strategy and the<br>
                    barriers to mobility, which follows the players’ different resources and poten-<br>
                    tials, as well as their differences in terms of goals and positioning with regard<br>
                    to risk. This leads to the formation of strategic groups within the industry. Yet,<br>
                    changes in the industry’s structure can facilitate the formation of new strategic<br>
                    groups or make the groups homogenous.</p>
                <p class="a">Strategic groups affect the barriers to mobility, bargaining power up and down<br>
                    the supply chain, the threat of substitutions and rivalry within the industry.<br>
                    Global barriers to entry differ greatly depending on the specific strategic group<br>
                    the newcomer intends to join, as well as creating barriers to changes of position<br>
                    from one strategic group to another. These barriers to mobility end up<br>
                    discouraging changing strategic position. High barriers explain differences in<br>
                    profitability between companies.</p>
                <p class="a">Strategic groups can also affect bargaining power in the chain, since they confer<br>
                    different degrees of vulnerability on common buyers and suppliers. Strategic<br>
                    groups permit one to focus on different parts of the product line, to serve<br>
                    different customers, to operate with different levels of quality and technological<br>
                    innovation, and to have different cost positions, minimizing the level of exposure<br>
                    to competition from substitute products</p>
                <p class="a">The presence of several strategic groups almost always affects the level of<br>
                    rivalry inside the industry, since there can be interdependence among the<br>
                    groups in the market or in their degree of overlap in targeting customers. The<br>
                    possibility of product differentiation achieved by the groups, the number and<br>
                    relative size of the strategic groups, strategic distancing between groups, or the<br>
                    degree of divergence of strategy are other factors that have impact on the global<br>
                    rivalry of the industry.</p>
                <p class="a">A company’s viability, as a function of its chosen strategic group, is affected by<br>
                    the structural analysis within the industry, as we have seen. Still, other factors<br>
                    affect the profitability of a company or group, such as the position of the<br>
                    company inside its group, the degree of competition within the group, the scale<br>
                    of the company in relation to others in the group, the cost of entry into the group,<br>
                    and the company’s ability to execute and implement its chosen strategy in<br>
                    operational terms.</p>
                <p class="a">It is worth stressing that it is not always true that a company with a larger market<br>
                    share is more viable. Larger companies will be more viable if they compete in<br>
                    strategic groups more protected by barriers to mobility and with a stronger position<br>
                    in the chain, and the smaller companies will be more viable if there are no large<br>
                    economies of scale and if they adopt differentiated strategies for service and<br>
                    technological innovation. This exception should not be taken as a rule, since that<br>
                    could lead to a commodity trap. The view that cost position is the sole sustainable<br>
                    factor on which a competitive strategy can be built, which can invade the territory<br>
                    of other areas of strategy, is not easily sustainable, an, in global low-cost positioning,<br>
                    is not always necessarily important.</p>

                <p class="a">The analysis and choice of which strategic groups one should compete in has<br>
                    implications in formulating strategy. Hence, these decisions have to take into<br>
                    consideration the comparison between a company’s strengths and weak-<br>
                    nesses, whether they are structural or related to implementing the selected<br>
                    strategy, and they must highlight distinctive competencies in order to maximize<br>
                    opportunities and minimize threats arising from the competitive environment.<br>
                    The SWOT analysis seen in Chapter I, allows us to visualize the impact of<br>
                    strategic groups on strategy in a structured way as illustrated in Table 2.1.</p>
                <h4 class="head">Strategic Groups Map</h4><hr class="hr">
                <p class="a">The map of strategic groups presents a graphic demonstration of competition<br>
                    in an industry, identifying the relative position of the diverse adversaries within it.</p>
                <p class="a">The map of strategic groups is laid out along two axes, which contain the critical<br>
                    dimensions for industry analysis, usually dealt with at two levels, high and low,<br>
                    as illustrated in Figure 2.5. Hence, the first step in mapping is to select the<br>
                    strategic variables that will be used along the axes. In order to do so, one needs<br>
                    to decide which variables determine the most important barriers to mobility for<br>
                    the industry.</p>

                <p class="a">Feka et al. (1997) state that total revenue can measure the size of each<br>
                    company, while its business focus can be seen in the percentage of sales in<br>
                    relation to the company’s total revenue. The market share of the analyzed<br>
                    company’s product in relation to its competitors determines its market posi-<br>
                    tioning. However, it is important to stress that other measurements could be<br>
                    used to represent better the competitive environment in a specific industry.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="head">Competitive Pressure Diagram</h4><hr class="hr">
                <p class="a">Another instrument to map the competitive environment is the competitive<br>
                    pressure diagram (D’Aveni, 2002). According to this author: “The more two<br>
                    firms’ products or geographic markets overlap, the more pressure they exert<br>
                    on each other. The pressure is proportional to the importance of markets to<br>
                    each firm and their degree of penetration. This simple concept enables<br>
                    organizations to quantify the degree of pressure that one rival puts on another.”<br>
                    As D’Aveni writes, pressure systems can never be frozen; the best that can be<br>
                    achieved is a kind of ‘dynamic stability’.
                    </p>
                <p class="a">D’Aveni (2002) states that the competitive pressure from a given incursion into<br>
                    a rival’s geographical or product market can be measured by two factors: the<br>
                    importance of the market (I.M.) and the size of the incursion (S.I.). This<br>
                    pressure is given by the formula:
                    </p>
                <p class="a">Competitive Pressure = I.M. S.I. <b style="padding-left: 30%;">(1)</b></p>
                <p class="a">Where:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 5%;font-size: 14px;">
                    <li><b class="c">I.M.: </b>The percentage of the targeted firm’s total revenue represented by
                        the market;</li>
                    <li> <b class="c">S.I.: </b>The market share achieved by the invading firm.
                        
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                <p class="a">Similarly, to the strategic groups, the pressures map is valid just for a short period.<br>
                    In this diagram, each circle represents one of the market players and arrows<br>
                    represent the pressure each player is exercising on the others. The diameters of the<br>
                    companies’ representative circles mean the size of the respective market share at<br>
                    that moment. The width of the arrows in the diagram indicates the intensity of the<br>
                    pressures.</p>
                <p class="a">These pressure maps can be also useful to take decisions about, offensive or<br>
                    defensive moves, in conjunction with other decision-making tools like the<br>
                    rivalry matrix, decision trees, and Game Theory. However, Furrer and Thomas<br>
                    (2000) warn that the analyzed market should have few decision variables and<br>
                    a predictable environment.</p>
                <p class="a">In both kinds of competitive environment maps, data about the market should<br>
                    be obtained from secondary sources in order to construct these diagrams.</p>

                    advantage in a market which is in constant mutation is an arduous task.<br>

                <p class="a">The word competence comes from the Latin, <i>competere.</i> The derivation of the<br>
